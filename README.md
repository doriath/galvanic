## About

`Galvanic` is a language for writing programs that will run on ICs in
[Stationeers](https://store.steampowered.com/app/544550/Stationeers/). The ICs
use an assembly language based on MIPS to allow for programmable logic in game.
Writing and refactoring programs can be a tedious and error-prone process.
Additionally there is a limitation on the number of lines of code available so
having a higher level representation that can be full of comments and quality of
life language features is beneficial.
